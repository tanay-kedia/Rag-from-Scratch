“I want a candy bar!”
Your 2-year-old daughter stands screaming in the middle of the grocery store checkout line as you look on in shock. With tears flowing, fists clenched, and her piercing wail echoing throughout the entire store, she is the absolute center of attention. 
Your 9-year-old son sits in the backseat of your minivan, his arms folded across his chest in pure defiance. He had wanted to go to the mall with his friends by himself, but you insisted on going as a chaperone.
“I promise, I will keep my distance,” you assure him. “You’re simply too young to go alone.”
However, your assurance does little to change his attitude. After spending the entire drive yelling at you for being so unfair, he’s now giving you the silent treatment. 
Your 16-year-old storms out of the house, slamming the door behind her as she makes her exit. “You’re being completely unfair!” she yells over her shoulder.
All you had asked her to do was to fill up the car with gas after she finished using it. Was that so unreasonable?

It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
You made it through the Terrible Twos, survived the Threenage years, and held on tight through all of the turmoil your Fournado brought about. Then, just when you thought the worst was behind you, you realized the cold, hard truth.
Tantrums happen.
Anytime. Anywhere. And at any age.


While there are plenty of tactics and tools parents can use to prevent temper tantrums from happening, there is no hard and clear rule that says tantrums are limited to a certain age group. 
In fact, even adults give in to the occasional tantrum every now and then.
While tantrums may happen at every age, they begin to look different as children grow. The crocodile tears and high pitched screams suddenly turn into eye rolls and slammed doors. The possibilities are endless and can be endlessly confusing for a stressed-out parent. 
So whether you have a toddler, a preschooler, a tween, or a teen, there is no better time to take a deeper look at tantrums through the ages than right now. Because when you have a better understanding of the role tantrums play at different ages, you’ll start to learn how to handle each one specifically; making your life–and your child’s–much less chaotic.

Toddler Tantrums (Ages 12 months to 4)

Tantrums during the ages of 12 months to 4 years are quite common as children are still learning to manage their emotions and communicate effectively. Here's what you might expect and some strategies to handle them:

Understanding Triggers: Tantrums can be triggered by various factors such as frustration, fatigue, hunger, changes in routine, or a desire for independence.

Intensity: Tantrums at this age can range from mild whining to full-blown screaming, kicking, and hitting. They can be intense and overwhelming for both the child and the caregiver.

Communication Challenges: Children at this age may not have the vocabulary to express their feelings or needs verbally, leading to frustration and tantrums.

Handling Tantrums:

Stay Calm: It's essential to remain calm and composed during a tantrum. Your calm demeanor can help de-escalate the situation.
Validate Feelings: Acknowledge your child's feelings even if you can't fulfill their request. Saying something like, "I understand that you're upset because you can't have the toy right now" can help them feel heard.
Offer Choices: Providing choices within limits can give your child a sense of control. For example, you can say, "You can't have candy now, but you can choose a healthy snack."
Distraction: Sometimes, redirecting your child's attention to something else can help diffuse the tantrum.
Set Clear Limits: Establishing consistent rules and boundaries can prevent tantrums triggered by confusion or uncertainty.
Use Positive Reinforcement: Praise your child when they manage their emotions well or express their needs calmly.
Teach Coping Skills: Help your child learn age-appropriate coping strategies like taking deep breaths or counting to ten when they feel upset.
Prevention: Anticipating and addressing potential triggers before they escalate into a tantrum can be helpful. Ensure your child is well-rested, fed, and engaged in age-appropriate activities.

Seek Support: Parenting can be challenging, especially when dealing with tantrums. Don't hesitate to seek support from other parents, caregivers, or professionals if you're feeling overwhelmed.

Remember, every child is different, and what works for one may not work for another. Consistency, patience, and empathy are key when handling tantrums during this developmental stage.

Tantrums between age 5years to 12 years:
Tantrums in children aged 5 to 12 can vary widely in intensity and frequency, but they often involve expressions of frustration, anger, or distress. At this age, children are developing more independence and social skills, but they still may struggle with managing their emotions effectively. Here's what tantrums might look like during this age range and some strategies for handling them:

Emotional Outbursts: Children may exhibit intense emotional reactions when they don't get what they want or when they feel overwhelmed. They might scream, cry, stomp their feet, or even become physically aggressive.

Resistance to Rules and Boundaries: As children grow, they may push back against rules and limits set by parents or caregivers. This resistance can sometimes manifest as tantrums, especially if they feel the rules are unfair or restrictive.

Difficulty Managing Frustration: Kids in this age group are still learning how to cope with disappointment and setbacks. When things don't go their way or when they encounter challenges, they may become frustrated and have tantrums as a result.

Social Influences: Peer interactions can also influence tantrum behavior. Children may experience frustration or jealousy in social situations, leading to outbursts or meltdowns.

Handling tantrums in this age group requires patience, understanding, and consistency. Here are some tips:

Stay Calm: It's essential to remain calm and composed during a tantrum. Getting upset or angry in response will only escalate the situation. Take deep breaths and try to maintain a neutral tone of voice.

Validate Feelings: Acknowledge your child's emotions, even if you don't agree with their behavior. Let them know that it's okay to feel angry, frustrated, or disappointed, but also emphasize that certain behaviors (like hitting or screaming) are not acceptable.

Set Clear Expectations: Establish clear rules and boundaries for behavior, and communicate them to your child in a calm manner. Consistency is key—enforce consequences consistently when rules are broken, but also offer praise and rewards for positive behavior.

Offer Choices: Give your child some control over their environment by offering choices whenever possible. For example, instead of telling them what to wear, give them a few options to choose from. This can help reduce power struggles and tantrums.

Teach Coping Skills: Help your child develop healthy coping mechanisms for managing emotions. This could include deep breathing exercises, counting to ten, or taking a break in a quiet space to calm down.

Use Positive Reinforcement: Catch your child being good and offer praise and rewards for positive behavior. This reinforces good behavior and encourages them to continue making positive choices.
